# How's it going?

So today, I was trying to observe how my new philosophy, i.e. 'everything in moderation' works.

I went to a celebration today, and there was a buffet. 

I had a good chance at eating too much.

I thought of this, and I held back. I mean, I took small servings of each variety, and took only twice for few.

However, by the end of the meal, I felt really heavy. 

Basically, it didn't feel like I had it in moderation. Which led to another feeling: guilty.

Now, the question arises is, what does moderation mean? 

I wanted to stick with gut instinct. Making hard rules doesn't work. 

Or maybe it will, if I understand myself really well. I haven't been that aware of myself. Yet.

I can follow hard rules without understanding myself, but I have seen that it blows back really hard later. 
Like for instance, if I decided to stop drinking tea, and I held back for a month. After a month, if I relapse, I'll drink more than 5 cups a day.
Which is much worse that how I was before the rule.

I don't want rules that push me too hard. I want my life, well moderated. My habits, in moderation.

Few years ago, I remember a senior of mine, who is one of the healthiest people I've ever met. He has the best hair, no dark circles,
best habits, good presence of mind, and many more. Basically, he was good, both physically and mentally. I asked him for his secret. 
He told me that its because he understands his body signals really well, and always responds to them.
The cues, however slight they might be, he used to address them right away. For example, he drinks water as soon as he feels even slightly dehydrated.
He sleeps immediately as soon as he feels exhausted. Or if he couldn't, he would address the backlog soon enough. 
He was able to create such awareness of himself mostly because, he meditates almost everyday. 
Man, he's really good!

Probably, my goal should be, to reach where he is. But I won't rush things. I'll get there, slowly. 
After that, there's no need to set rules. I'll do things that are right, automatically. 


For now, here's my approach.
- I'll always remain aware of my philosophy. 
- Instead of losing my mind over missing moderation, I'll try to gather feedback and make changes for future instances. 
- Will stay slow, but remain consistent, whatsoever. 

That's it for now.


From Monday onwards, I'll start following a few rules, which are must, but easy to follow through. Also, not too many.

Will update tomorrow.

Wish me luck!!!
