# Unexpected Impact

Ever since I made this habit of sleeping by 12 o clock, it had an unintended effect.

You see, I slack off whole day, and then get active at night. 
This way, I ensure I meet my targets. 

However, now that I'm trying to sleep by 12, I'm unable to achieve my goals. 

And, the whole day, there are a lot of interruptions, which leads to limited productivity.
I guess I need to figure out a solution for this.

I dont' need to extend my sleep timeline. It doesn't really help anyway, I still need the sleep!

I need to figure out how I can make my day productive.
Will think about it further.

1. Need to figure out a routine for my hair.
2. Algorithmic Trading, or content writing? Need to prioritize now. (Software engineering is not going out. It's hightest priority)
