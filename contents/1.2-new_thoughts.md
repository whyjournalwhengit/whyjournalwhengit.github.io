# Some close, while some open

One of the projects I was working on was closed today.

Mostly because of budget cuts. I wasn't too much down about it. Mainly because I can understand the rationale.
We removed that primarily because we can address that requirement through other existing tools at disposal.
There didn't seem a point to keep it now, not when even employment is at peril.
So, makes total sense.


Anyways, closure of this project means that I have more bandwidth for new interesting projects. 
I can do more things on data science, figure out some more cloud technologies, 
think about learning new skills as a developer, and what not. 
So, all good.


Also, got some unconvential investment idea. Inspired by one of my friends. Might be long term, but it might give 
significant returns. Worth a shot, I guess.
Will understand his evaluation strategy tomorrow and get started. 

Rest, day as good as usal.

Few running thoughts
1. Gotta make a plan for cloud technologies learning. Not sure how
2. Gotta understand the essentials things in data science. Not entirely sure how to plan this. 
3. Couldn't continue my platform based learning plan. Need to figure it out.
