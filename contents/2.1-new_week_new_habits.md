# Learn. Change. Grow

Life stays interesting if there's change around.

The world gives health to motion. 
Circulating water is healthy, stagnant goes bad. 
Ventilated room is good, Stagnant room is bad. 

You don't become irrelevant because you are old. You become irrelevant because you stopped learning.

Anyways, confirmation bias aside, the intention is to say that I'm bringing in a new habit. 
To meditate 10 minutes everyday. Not more than that.
Could be anytime. No rules on that.
Fine as long as I atleast sit somewhere, blank, not doing anything else.
Will start the tracker from tomorrow.
