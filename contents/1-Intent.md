# Intent?

Hard to say.... I'm still gathering my thoughts.

Well, here's the problem. The world has become too confusing.

Everywhere I see, there's someone who has started earning millions via blogging, or lost 20 kgs in 3 months, rejected an admission at Harvard, 
started a new startup on AI, wrote 50+ high quality articles in a week with Chat GPT, and what not. Damn, achievements seem too commonplace these days.

Everyone is sharing their own paybooks, tips and tricks, success stories, earnings, training materials, courses, tools, and so many other things that,
its now really hard to keep track. 

Oddly, I'm not even on TikTok, Snap, Josh, (or if there's some other glammy one),
have close to null activity on instagram and Facebook, and still, I feel so overwhelmed.

Gone were the days when I'd feel good about congratulating someone for a new job offer, or feel good about connecting with someone. 
All I could see now is, same guides, reports, lingering around, where I have no clue which to follow and which to not. 

There is too much content, too many options, soo many attractions, and very less time. 

Not really sure what's good, and what's mine. 

Finally, I realised, I can't keep up. In fact, even if I could, I wouldn't want to. 

However, I still wanted to do something. Which needed some motivation. 

Likewise, I needed a way to maintain track. 

And most importantly, I needed to organise my thoughts. I mean, I need to choose something and stick with it for a while, whether I like it or not.
Publishing my ideas here and going from there seemed like making a commitment. It'll be a little hard to break. 

I genuinely hope this idea works. 

Let's see.
