# A little bored

I have a bad habit.

Whenever something good starts to become my routine, I go out of my way to break it.

And that's what happened yesterday.

I stayed up to watch a movie even after 12 o clock. And the worst part is, I started it after 12.

I'll try my best to remember this pattern and fix it.

The day also went in a lethargic format. That's really bad. 
Damn, I really wish I slept early.

Also, observed an interesting pattern. I really, really want to follow good things. I break them only because I feel bored,
or it is a force of habit. I think I am changing, albeit a bit slowly. 

Well, it's not like I have a deadline anyway.

Meditation is slowly getting on to my life. However, it might need more time for me to actually do it right.

Atleast I started. That's a big win, I guess.

Also, I need to start working on my tech skills I mentioned to my lead. 
Damn, I haven't started it yet. Need to do soemthing about it.

Might make it a part of my habit.


The whole NLP thing is getting a little scary. I really, really gotta do something about this.
Will think about it further.
