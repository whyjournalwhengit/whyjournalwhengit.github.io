# Time to get started!

Well, as I said earlier, I'm planning to share a few goals I plan to target for this year.

Maybe, instead of saying goals, I could say, habits. 

I was thinking of adopting a few habits that can help me grow consistently. 

Like, for instance, journaling everyday, drinking more water everyday, etc.

Will update on my goals by the end of this doc.


Btw, I wanted to share a few things. 
1. Real Estate is a real hassle.
2. Some people are just real immature.

About the first one, I recently learnt some interesting things.

Let's say that, you go to a bank asking for mortgage. Now, the expectation is that, the bank will verify your credentials, verify the documents,
and give you the loan.

And you'd think that, a good bank will spend more time evaluating the documents and extend the loan, right?

Not really true.

The bank is generally concerned about your ability to pay back the loan, not really much concerned about the asset ownership.
It may not even verify it properly. It could even happen that, you are tagged with a huge loan for a document which holds absolutely no sense.

Now, you'll be paying a loan for a long period of time (because you can, and the bank already verified that), and in the end, you 
might be getting an asset with conflicted ownership. Or, inaccurate details. Or, there could be any other issue.

Although, you might say that if the document is not good, why would you continue to pay the loan? But, how would you get out of it?
Not really possible for a law abiding citizen, right? 
In the end, the bank did lend you money, right? 

So, if you want to buy an asset, always do your own due diligence. The broker might say that they'll get you a loan from a premiere bank,
or the documents are accurate, or they'll get you to talk to an attorney, or many other loads of crap, but please don't rely on it.

The last important thing is, when someone says that a bank is willing to extend loan on a document, that doesn't establish the genuinity of the 
document. Banks aren't that reliable. You are on your own, better figure out everything yourself. 

Man, almost everyone is inattentive, disinterested, or has no understanding at all. They'll try to tell you anything they can to convince you. 
The documents might be unclear, but you need to get the complete understanding, some way or the other. 
Else, be ready to get screwed. 
Either now, or later. 

I'll probably write a blog later about my crappy experience in this. Might help you get a sense of what I'm saying.

It's hard to write about the other point.

Simple Brief: It was about a marriage alliance that went really bad, mainly because of the girl's immature nature. I won't be able to delve into it 
further.

Well, this closes most of the things.

One last thing: I couldn't follow the moderation rule yesterday... I stayed up till quite late and ate a lot in the night. 
Need to come up with a rule now.


So, here are the rules I'm planning to follow:
1. Sleep by 12 o clock
2. Drink Amla and Aloevera Juice everyday
3. Live life in moderation

Will update everyday as a checklist.
