# Isn't it interesting?

Yesterday, I spent my evening with one of my seniors, who has been one of my closest friends since more than 5 years.

We discussed our careers, our plans for future, about the crap going on in the society, and what not.

I had a good time :)

Also, I travelled with my own bike, so that's another achievement. Yayyy!!!


The evolution of technology has been kept me on toes for a while now. 
I'm constantly unsure of how I should proceed next, what kind of things I should do, what I should keep learning, etc.
Overall, the one thing I know is, it's really interesting!!!


I think the next few months will have a significant accelerated learning pace. 
I might build some interesting things, create a few new projects, get to learn many new things, and scale up really fast.
Though I am not sure how well I'll be able to convert all of these into finance, but I am quite sure that'll also happen.

Well, right now, I just want to keep learning. After that, I'll plan for some more interesting things.

Currently, I don't have much to say, though I know that I'm unable to match my promises everyday. However, I'm confident that I'll figure it out.

Btw, I didn't sleep early, but since we spent our time talking, its okay.
