# Monday Blues

It was a good day. 

I went through a lot of documentations, and actually understood most of the things.

Not my strong suit, actually.

Beyond that, the day was fine.

I did get into a career crisis line of thought though.
Basically, with the ChatGPT in picture, it can make anyone's role redundant. 
Made me think about how the future of humanity would be.
Well, that's a discussion for another day.


Good things:
1. I might sleep by 12 (mostly possible)
2. I had both aloevera and amla
3. Most of my activities were in moderation

Habit Counter
1. 1
2. 1

New checks needed:
