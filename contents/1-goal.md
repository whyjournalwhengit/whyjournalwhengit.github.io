# Goal?

Haven't figured it out yet. I mean, not completely, but I have a basic idea.

One of the things is, I'm doing this mostly to address my personal issues. So, the solution has to be something that addresses them.

So, before I do that, I need to identify my issues first. 

I do know a few, though.


One of my major problems is, always going extreme. Never going in moderation.

It's like, if I get into binge watching, I'll probably watch 2-3 days at stretch. Only 5-10 minute sugar breaks, nothing else.

Generally, not even sleep times!

And the problem is, its not just with one thing. I go to an extreme in eating, reading, working out, sitting, and what not.

This is probably my major issue.

Gotta bring things in moderation.


The another issue, which is probably similar to this is, limited consistency.

I think it's smarter if I can read a book 30 minutes everyday for 30 days, rather than read the whole book in a day. 

I'm unable to make that change. And, I keep doing that.

I'll think about addressing these two major issues first. 


The goal is quite simple: Everything in moderation.


If I can address this, this means I'm already getting better!
